If you are interested in translating YCWP QR Me, use default.po as a template to create a po file for the new translation file.
The resulting translated file should be named with the following format:

- ycwp-qr-me- - ISO 639 language code (lowercase) - an underscore - ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (uppercase)  - .mo 
So for an Italian translation, the file name would be ycwp-qr-me-it_IT.po  Please send the translated file to: mail@nicolamustone.it Thanks!
